----DataSynapse: A Social Data Curation Foundry-------------

Social data analytics have become a vital asset for organizations and governments. For example, over the last few years, governments started to extract knowledge and derive insights from vastly growing open data to personalize the advertisements in elections, improve government services, predict intelligence activities, as well as to improve national security and public health. A key challenge in analyzing social data is to transform the raw data generated by social actors into curated data, i.e. contextualized data and knowledge that is maintained and made available for use by end-users and applications. To address this challenge, we present a social data curation foundry, namely DataSynapse, to enable analysts engage with social data to uncover hidden patterns and generate insight. DataSynapse is offered as an extensible and scalable microservice-based architecture that are publicly available on GitHub supporting networks such as Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus and LinkedIn.
